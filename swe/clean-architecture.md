## What is design and architecture?
- Architecture is often used in the context of high level that is divorced from the low-level details. Design focuses on structures and decisions at a lower level. 


## Paradigms
- Structured programming - Discovered by Dijkstra in 1968. Structued programming imposes discipline on direct transfer of control.
- Object-Oriented programming - Discovered in 1966 by Dahl and Nygaard. Object-oriented porgramming imposes the discipline on indirect transfer of control.
- Functional programming - Direct work onf Alonzo Church.. Functional programming imposes discipline upon assignment.
