## What is this?
This repository is a way for me to compile all of my notes, written in markdown, into one singular GitHub repository. 
<br/> Why? I enjoy using GitHub and learning new things. GitHub has been a place where I have hosted all of my personal projects over the years, both public and private. I enjoy learning new things and taking notes on them, but recently just using paper notes have not been able to cut it for me. I have recently picked up a new tool for note taking called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) which has helped my note taking, and taught me how to write markdown files.
