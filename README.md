## What is this?
This repository is a way for me to compile all of my notes, written in markdown, into one singular GitHub repository. 
<br/> Why? I enjoy using GitHub and learning new things. GitHub has been a place where I have hosted all of my personal projects over the years, both public and private. I enjoy learning new things and taking notes on them, but recently just using paper notes have not been able to cut it for me. I have recently picked up a new tool for note taking called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) which has helped my note taking, and taught me how to write markdown files.

## Who can use this?
Anyone! Most of the things in this repository will be relating to the world of Computing and Software Engineering. I will also have some things in this repository that just relate to some personal interests outside of computing as well. I would love for this repository to be used by people all over the world as a resource to learn more, and to share knowledge with others.
