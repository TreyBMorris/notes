## What is this?
This repository is a way for me to compile all of my notes, written in markdown, into one singular GitHub repository. 
<br/> Why? I love using GitHub and Markdown for source control. I love the fact that I can be on any machine and use a command to pull files
from a repository to my local machine and being able to constantly maintain it. I also have been using NeoVim for my notes taking recently. 
## Who can use this?
Anyone! Most of the things in this repository will be relating to the world of Computing and Software Engineering. I will also have some things in this repository that just relate to some personal interests outside of computing as well. I would love for this repository to be used by people all over the world as a resource to learn more, and to share knowledge with others.
