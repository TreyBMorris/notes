# Describing Syntax and Semantics

## Syntax
- The form or structure of the expressions, statements, and program units


## Semantics
- The meaning of the expressions, statements, and program units
- Syntax and semantics provide a language's definition
- User of a language definition
  - Other language designers
  - Implementers
  - Programmers

## The general problem of describing syntax: terminology
- A sentence is a string of characters over some alphabet
- A language is a set of sentences 
- A lexeme is the lowest level syntactic unit of language
- A token is a category of lexemes 


### Formal Definition of Languages
- Recognizers
  - A recognition device reads input strings over the alphabet of the language and decides whether the input strings belong to the language. 
- Generators
  - A device that generates sentences of a language
  - One can determine if the syntax of a particular sentence is syntactically correct by comparing it to the structure of the generator
