# Expressions and Assignment Statements
Expressions are the fundamental means of specifying computations in a programming language. To understand expression evaluation, we need 
to be familliar with orders of operator and operand evaluation.
Essence of imperative languages is dominant role of assignment statements.

## Arithmetic Expressions
- Arithmetic evaluation was one of the motivations for the development of the first programming languages
- Arithmetic expressions consist of operators, operands, parentheses, and function calls
- An perator can be unary, meaning it has a single operand; binary meaning it has two operands; and ternary, meaning it has three operands
- Operator precedence rules, typical precedence levels
    - parentheses
    - unary
    - ** operators
    - * / 
    - + - 
- Conditional expressions as well like ==
