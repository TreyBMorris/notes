# What is Linux?

Linux is an open source operating system, first developed by Linus Torvalds.
In the world of Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Information Technology, Linux is something that is important to understand the concepts of. 

## Kernel and Shell
The kernel is the absolute most basic component of the operating system, which acts as the communicator between the hardware and the software of your computer. Any commands entered by the user are processed by the kernel through the shell and are returned back to the user. The shell is a program where a user inputs commands or instructions into the operating system. This acts as an interface that reads and processes comands from the user, and returns them back to the user. One of the most popular and notable shells in Linux is the Bourne Again Shell, or most commonly referred to as Bash. For those who are Windows users, a common comparison to Bash would be the PowerShell. In macOS, we also commonly use Bash.
