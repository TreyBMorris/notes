# The C Programming Language
[Back to Main](https://github.com/TreyBMorris/notes)
## What is C?
- According to book "The C Programming Language" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie, "C is a general-purpose programming language. It has been closely associated with the UNIX system, since it was developed on that system, and since UNIX and its software are written in C." 
- C is usually referred to as a low level language. 
- One major thing that I have found when first learning C is that C does NOT have a "string" object. Most programming languages like Java, have a string class with many methods. In C however, strings are stored as a character array (char) and there are no methods associated with a character array.
