# Universal Usability

- We need to meet user needs, and address the needs of all users. Things like international consumer market with mobile devices, drive the need for universally usable designs.
- We also need to add variations in design for disabilities and needing to be ADA compliant.
 - Screen-brightness preferences
 - Sense perception: Vision (depth, contrast color blindness), touch, hearing
 - Design can help and hinder performance
- Design to also include cultural and international diversity
  - Designing for cell phones can open the door to a wider audience

#### Users with Disabilities
- Designers must plan early to accommodate users with disabilities
- Early planning is more cost efficient than adding on later.
- Businesses must comply with the "Americans with Disabilities Act" (ADA) for some applications.

#### Other use cases for different types of design
- Older adult users might need a different type of design. One such case can include having variability with the application for settings with sound, color, brightness, font-sizes, and more.
- Children use tablets and these designs can be used to help children learn.
